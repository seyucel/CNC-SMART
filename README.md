## SMART: Standardized Morphology Analysis for Research and Technology <br/>
CNC_SMART is a semi-automated image analysis system to obtain the particle size measurements of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) using TEM or AFM images.
Detailed explanation of the CNC-SMART can be found at our first paper, ['Semi-automatic image analysis of particle morphology of cellulose nanocrystals'](https:10.1007/s10570-020-03668-8), published in January 2021 by Cellulose.
