## SMART: Standardized Morphology Analysis for Research and Technology <br/>
	CNC_SMART is a semi-automated image analysis system to obtain the particle size measurements of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) using TEM or AFM images. <br/>
	Detailed explanation of the CNC-SMART can be found at our first paper, 'Semi-automatic image analysis of particle morphology of cellulose nanocrystals', published in Cellulose journal (DOI: 10.1007/s10570-020-03668-8 ).
